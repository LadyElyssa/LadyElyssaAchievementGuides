# Lady Elyssa's Achievement & Collection Guides

A new collection of TacO Markers and Trails for use with GW2 TacO (Online Marker Packs) and Blish HUD (Markers and Trails icon, Download Marker Packs) focusing purely on Achievements and Collections. 

This pack starts off with Secrets of the Obscure with Janthir Wilds to follow. After that I will begin working my way backwards through the achievements to the oldest of achieves.
