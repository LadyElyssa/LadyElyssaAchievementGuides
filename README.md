For more information on Getting Started with either [GW2 TacO](https://www.gw2taco.com/) or [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/), see [here](https://github.com/LadyElyssa/LadyElyssaAchievementGuides/wiki/Getting-Started).

A new collection of Markers and Trails for use with [GW2 TacO](https://www.gw2taco.com/) (Online Marker Packs) and [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) (Markers and Trails icon, Download Marker Packs) and look for Lady Elyssa's Achievements & Collections.

This pack focuses purely on Achievements and Collections by [Lady Elyssa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lady_Elyssa) comprising of **_1750+ Trails_** and **_7800+ Markers_**. [[1]](https://mp-repo.blishhud.com/LadyElyssaAP.taco.html), [[2]](https://somsubhra.github.io/github-release-stats/?username=LadyElyssa&repository=LadyElyssaAchievementGuides&page=1&per_page=10000), [[3]](https://qwertycube.com/github-release-stats/) 

Principles
* Markers and Trails for non-repeatable Achievements & Collections, for mostly repeatable content see [LadyElyssaTacoTrails](https://github.com/LadyElyssa/LadyElyssaTacoTrails)
* Aim to provide smooth trails by:
   * avoiding un-necessary combat
   * minimising terrain obstacles, like bushes, rocks or trees
   * minimising the need to adjust the camera
   * why jump when you can walk

This pack currently covers:
