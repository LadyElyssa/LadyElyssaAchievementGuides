A new collection of Markers and Trails for use with [GW2 TacO](https://www.gw2taco.com/) (Online Marker Packs) and [Blish HUD](https://blishhud.com/) (Markers and Trails icon, Download Marker Packs) and look for Lady Elyssa's Achievements & Collections.

This pack focuses purely on Achievements and Collections by [Lady Elyssa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lady_Elyssa) with over **_6,000_** downloads (as of November 2024).

This pack began with Secrets of the Obscure and followed up with Janthir Wilds. I am now working my way back through the End of Dragons, Path of Fire and finally Heart of Thorns expansion before working my way forwward through the Living World Episodes.

Principles
* Markers and Trails for non-repeatable Achievements & Collections, for mostly repeatable content see [LadyElyssaTacoTrails](https://github.com/LadyElyssa/LadyElyssaTacoTrails)
* Aim to provide smooth trails by:
   * avoiding un-necessary combat
   * minimising terrain obstacles, like bushes, rocks or trees
   * minimising the need to adjust the camera
   * why jump when you can walk
